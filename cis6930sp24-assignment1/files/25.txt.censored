Hi ****,

I would like to creat a product for Enron Online for trades on Alliance 
Pipeline.  As you probably know, Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to 
start commercial service effective *****************.  As with any new 
pipeline, this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date.   I would 
like to create a product that has a description that addresses the 
uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that 
gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial.

Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation.

I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible.

Thank you
